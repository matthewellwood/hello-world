# hello-world
I'm a Mature (??) student coming back to coding after only ever using it as an interest, and looking to learn all sorts of new languages and skills to enable me to work in the field doing something I enjoy, so I can get up each morning and be happy knowing I'm going to spend the day getting paid for something I love to do.
