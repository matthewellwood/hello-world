# hello-world
I'm currently a student coming back to coding after only ever using it as a hobby, and looking to learn all sorts of new languages and skills to enable me to work in the field doing something I enjoy, so I can get up each morning and be happy knowing I'm going to spend the day getting paid for something I love to do.
I have previously studied Pascal and C, and before that GW Basic.
I am currently studying Data Analytics, SQL and Python.
